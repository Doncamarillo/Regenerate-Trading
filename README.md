### REGENERATE Trading


## Concept

Using Finnhub api, Regenerate trading takes the common practice of degenerate traders opening and closing trades with no conviction 
to using more sensability when forming their trade ideas allowing them to not only plan their trades but take away some of the emotional 
aspect of trading ultimately maximizing profit potential and cutting losses. Regenerate trading can prove to be useful to not only degenerate traders 
treating the market as a casino but also seasoned veterns in the market that want an accesible way to log their trades.

## Functionality

Finnhub api will extract data that will help traders identify key statistics in a stock they want to play. As it is a free API, it doesn't allow to pull
actual charts but it will display the name of the stock, the ticker symbol, last close, the open price, high of day, and low of day.
Regenerate trading will include add texts boxes for traders to add their personal predetermined stop losses, take profit price, and a target for entry price.

Added links on the bottom for online broker platforms to execute trades with added designated ad space below those links on the page footer

Clicking the header will also reset the page to its initial state
